# TreasureHuntGame

The Treasure Hunt Game is a project we used to learning how to create a pathfinding game where there is an agent tryin to find the best path through a maze. The goal is to find the treasure before the AI pirate does. We taught the pirate agent to learn the optimal path by using a deep Q-learning algorithm. The pirate agent starts out with no information regarding the run environment in a random spot. Within the first few games the pirate learns how to win and then consistently retains a win rate against the player. In this assignment we coded the Q-Training portion! 


## Connecting

Computer scientist utilize learning algorithms of all types to teach machines to process large amounts of data and generate information and processing software which automates and improves problem-solving based on what the machine was taught. Ultimately, approaching these problems should involve a multitude including what the resolution should look like, the requirements of the software to evaluate different methodds and how, what type of data the training program is being fed, and the ultimate ethical implementation of the learnings. When it comes to these programs, there are concerns ethically surrounding the intended or unintended biases that may be fed via either the ingested data, unnecessary information, the algorithm itself, and other matters. There's also the concern of the privacy of users and the information approved for usage. When certain corporate or government bodies gain access to data illegally there is the concern for the general populations privacy due to their data being used to make informed decisions regarding their interaction with the world without their consent.
